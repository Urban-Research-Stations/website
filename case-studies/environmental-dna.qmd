## Overview

Environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling is used to detect and monitor biodiversity in the Nature Discovery Garden by analyzing genetic material present in environmental samples.

## Objectives

- Detect species presence through DNA analysis of soil and water samples
- Monitor biodiversity changes over time
- Identify cryptic species that may be missed by traditional survey methods
- Complement traditional ecological survey techniques

## Methods

[Description of sampling protocols, DNA extraction methods, sequencing approaches]

## Results

[Current findings on species detected through eDNA]

## Future Work

[Planned sampling campaigns and method improvements]

## Team

[List of team members involved in this project]

## Publications
